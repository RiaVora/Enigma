# Enigma
An coded replica of the "code" behind the infamous World War II Enigma deconding machine. 
The Enigma Machine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) was the encryption device used by Nazi Germany during WWII to protect all sorts of secret communication. My coded replica uses Java to replicate the physical parts of the machine and the unique attributes of each part. I created classes for the different types of Rotors (distinguished with inheritance), the Reflector, the Alphabets, the Permutations for each Rotor, the Machine, and a Main file. The Rotors, Reflector, Permutations, and Alphabet were set by configuration files, which were in a specific format the Main file would interpret using regular expressions (regex). The Machine would then use the information and the given message to decode that message.
